# The-Weighted-Balls
You have nine identical-looking balls, but one of them is slightly heavier or lighter than the rest. You also have a balance scale, which you can use only twice. Can you determine which ball is the odd one out and whether it's heavier or lighter?

Solution:
To solve this puzzle, follow these steps:

Divide the nine balls into three groups of three balls each: Group A, Group B, and Group C.

Weigh Group A against Group B on the balance scale:
a. If they balance, the odd ball is in Group C. Proceed to step 3.
b. If they don't balance, proceed to step 3.

Take the heavier group (let's assume it's Group A) and select any two balls from it. Weigh these two balls against each other on the balance scale:
a. If they balance, the odd ball is the remaining one in Group A, and it is heavier or lighter depending on the previous weighing.
b. If they don't balance, the odd ball is the heavier one of the two balls being weighed.

Using this approach, you can identify the odd ball and determine whether it is heavier or lighter in just two weighings.
